This dataset contains two types of datasets:

1. Electrical events annotation: which shows electrical events captured at different granularities for different appliances
2. Multi-modal dataset: Smaller dataset where residents recorded their activity, across appliance usage, water consumption, occupancy etc.

#### Electrical events annotation

Event sequence was recorded on 4th August 2013. All times are Indian Standard Time (IST = GMT+5.5 hrs). Here ID refers to ID in the room. For example, if there are 4 identical fans in the room, it would suffice to label one of them, which may take ID from 1-4.
