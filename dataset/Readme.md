This dataset contains two types of datasets:

1. Electrical events annotation: which shows electrical events captured at different granularities for different appliances
2. Multi-modal dataset: Smaller dataset where residents recorded their activity, across appliance usage, water consumption, occupancy etc.

#### Electrical events annotation

Event sequence was recorded on 4th August 2013. All times are Indian Standard Time (IST = GMT+5.5 hrs). Here ID refers to ID in the room. For example, if there are 4 identical fans in the room, it would suffice to label one of them, which may take ID from 1-4.

#### Multi-modal dataset

The instrumented home has 3 occupants- A, B and C. The following is a collection of events "recorded" to nearest proximity by the residents. The residents continues their routines and tried to record as many events as possible.

This dataset is of the form

    <-timestamp, [event1, event2, â€¦]->
where

    event = <-person, object, action->
